    <p> What is the CSS Transition Property and what can it do for us? 
    </p>

    <p> The CSS Transition Property is applied to a specific element 
        to make other proporties of the element transition smoothly over a given duration 
        , or animate it in a nice way 
      </p>

      <button>css transition</button>

      <p>____________________________________</p>

      <p> Now onto the Transition-timing-function</p>
      <p> This controls how the change in the property will occur</p>
      <ul>
          <li> ease : the change starts slow and then goes faster, then finishes slow</li>
          <li> linear : the change occurs at the same rate </li>
          <li> ease-in : the change starts slow and then goes faster before the end</li>
          <li> ease-out : the changes starts fast then slows down before the end</li>
          <li> ease-in-out: the change starts slow then goes faster then finishes slow</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="container">
          <div id="ease" class="move">Ease (default)</div>
          <div id="linear" class="move">Linear</div>
          <div id="ease-in" class="move">Ease-In</div>
          <div id="ease-out" class="move">Ease-Out</div>
          <div id="ease-in-out" class="move">Ease-In-Out</div>
      </div>

       <p> There is also the Transition-Delay property which sets the time before the transition starts</p>
        <p> it accepts values in seconds or milliseconds</p>
        
        <p>You can also add more then one property to the transistion property CSS to effect more then one element</p>
        <p>transition-property: background-color color width;</p>
        <p> so each property seperated by a space, but if you need to apply the transition to alot, you can also put All
        <p>transition-property: all;</p>
        <p>There is also a faster way, just by using "transition" you can pass multiple css options into one
        </p>
        <p>transition: background-color 3s ease-in-out 1s, color 2s ease 4s;</p>

        <p> Important to note, not all CSS properties can use CSS transitions since they are not animatable</p>
        <ul>
            <li>background-image</li>
            <li>display</li>
            <li>border-style</li>
            <li>position</li>
            <li>float</li>
            <li>background-repeat</li>
            <li>font-family</li>
            <li> and many others</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Animated properties are those that can be expressed by numbers becasue the browser can interpurt the values such as width, height, border-width, padding, margin, opacity, etc </p>
        <p> We can also animate properties that can be expressed by color such as the properties color and background-color </p>

        <h1> Now there are a few basics we can get into with 2D transformation Basics.
            The Transform Property specifcally has 4 properties we can use
        </h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Scale Function, which increases or decreases the height and width</li>
            <li>The Translate Function which allows us to move the elment to any spot we want horizontally or vertically</li>
            <li>The Rotate Function which allows us to rotate the elements in a 2d environmment</li>
            <li>The Skew Function that allows us to skew the element along the x and/or y axis</li> 
        </ul>

        <p> so lets put the translate function into practice</p>
        <p> for this little kitty cat pic, we are using the "translate to move it both along the x & y axis. You could do just one like TranslateX or TranslateY, or just Translate which can take in both X & Y in that order, with X first and y last.</p>

        <br/>
        <p> Now lets try the scale function to make the Pussy Grow!r</p>
        <p> We can use scaleX to incease the elements width if the value is greater then 1, or decrase it if its less then one.  </p>
        <p>Or scaleY which increases or decreases the elements height depending if the value is positve or negative </p>
        <p>And we can just use Scale and pass in two values (x & y) into it to change both the width and height at the same time </p>

        <img src="cat.jpg" class="cat2" alt="">

        <br/>
        <p>Now lets Rotate that damn pussy!</p>

        <img src="cat.jpg" class="cat3" alt="">

        <br/>
        <p>Now lets skew that poor pussy!</p>
        <p> Like the scale function, skew can rotate skewX, or skewY, or just Skew with X & Y passed into it. </p>

        <img src="cat.jpg" class="cat4" alt="">

        <br/>
        <p>Now lets work with the Transform Origin Property</p>
        <p> transform origins defualt point is the center, but you can afix it to other places like corners</p>
        <p> It can accept keywords like "top, right, bottom, left" which make it pivot at each center point</p>
        <p> It can also accept top right, bottom right, bottom left, and top left which make it pivot at the corners.</p>
        <p>transform origin can also accept values as percentages </p>

        <img src="cat.jpg" class="cat5" alt="">
        <br/>
        <img src="cat.jpg" class="cat6" alt="">

        <p> Now we will work alittle with making this pussy have fun in 3D. Where as 2D uses the X & Y axis, 3D intorudces the Z axis. </p>

        <p>Important to note, with 3D environments, you need to set the perspective. </p>
