    <p> What is the CSS Transition Property and what can it do for us? 
    </p>

    <p> The CSS Transition Property is applied to a specific element 
        to make other proporties of the element transition smoothly over a given duration 
        , or animate it in a nice way 
      </p>

      <button>css transition</button>

      <p>____________________________________</p>

      <p> Now onto the Transition-timing-function</p>
      <p> This controls how the change in the property will occur</p>
      <ul>
          <li> ease : the change starts slow and then goes faster, then finishes slow</li>
          <li> linear : the change occurs at the same rate </li>
          <li> ease-in : the change starts slow and then goes faster before the end</li>
          <li> ease-out : the changes starts fast then slows down before the end</li>
          <li> ease-in-out: the change starts slow then goes faster then finishes slow</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="container">
          <div id="ease" class="move">Ease (default)</div>
          <div id="linear" class="move">Linear</div>
          <div id="ease-in" class="move">Ease-In</div>
          <div id="ease-out" class="move">Ease-Out</div>
          <div id="ease-in-out" class="move">Ease-In-Out</div>
      </div>

       <p> There is also the Transition-Delay property which sets the time before the transition starts</p>
        <p> it accepts values in seconds or milliseconds</p>
        
        <p>You can also add more then one property to the transistion property CSS to effect more then one element</p>
        <p>transition-property: background-color color width;</p>
        <p> so each property seperated by a space, but if you need to apply the transition to alot, you can also put All
        <p>transition-property: all;</p>
        <p>There is also a faster way, just by using "transition" you can pass multiple css options into one
        </p>
        <p>transition: background-color 3s ease-in-out 1s, color 2s ease 4s;</p>

        <p> Important to note, not all CSS properties can use CSS transitions since they are not animatable</p>
        <ul>
            <li>background-image</li>
            <li>display</li>
            <li>border-style</li>
            <li>position</li>
            <li>float</li>
            <li>background-repeat</li>
            <li>font-family</li>
            <li> and many others</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Animated properties are those that can be expressed by numbers becasue the browser can interpurt the values such as width, height, border-width, padding, margin, opacity, etc </p>
        <p> We can also animate properties that can be expressed by color such as the properties color and background-color </p>
